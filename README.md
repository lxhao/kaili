================================================================================
### A Solution to Building Desktop Application Using HTML5 and Node.js

heX is a solution that provides a new way to build cross-platform desktop application using web technology. heX is based on CEF and integrates Chromium and Node.js. Modules or third-party extensions of Node.js can be "required" from the web page, while the DOM element of HTML can also be visited from Node.js' modules. In addition, heX can be embedded as a web container module into desktop projects, allowing desktop applications to take advantage of HTML5 features.

### Debugging Node.js in developer tools
 * HeXium = Chromium + Node.js


## Why should I use heX?

HTML5 standard was designated as a Candidate Recommendation in December 2012. Chromium as a rapid development of open source project has good support for HTML5 for a long time. On the other hand, Node.js, which uses an event-driven, high throughput non-blocking I/O model, provides a variety of native operating APIs and enables a rich set of functionalities for JavaScript. heX integrates the two and retains advantages of both components. It enables one to develop desktop applications via pure web front-end technology.

heX has the following advantages:
 * Easy to use, web developer can use their favorite technology (browser and Node.js APIs), the learning cost is quite low.
 * Designing GUI is as efficient as we debug a web page in the Chrome.
 * Based on Node.js convenient extension mechanism, the functionalities can be easily extended.


## Why was HeXium born

A solution for developing and debugging traditional web front and Node.js even more JavaScript host environments by the cross-platform way.
  * Developer tools for heX as we develop web pages in Chrome
  * An environment to debug Node.js.


## How to develop with heX?

Developing a desktop application with heX is very simple. The following Wiki references allow you to get started quickly. [ links are coming soon. ]

 * heX Manifest Instructions
 * heX Native API Instructions
 * FAQ


A piece of sample code looks like this:
```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var directory = $('#directory');
var fileList = $('#filelist');
directory.value = process.cwd();
if (!fs.existsSync(dir)) {
  ...
} else {
  fs.readdir(dir, function(err, list) {
    ...
  }
}
```
